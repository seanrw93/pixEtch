An etch-a-sketch project as part of the Odin Project course using Javascript and DOM manipulation

NOTE: the drawing feature is accomplished with clicking and holding the mouse down on the grid, however this is still a little bit buggy. With my current knowledge I am not really able to identify the cause of this, but I have the full intention to look at this project again in the future once my skills have further improved.
